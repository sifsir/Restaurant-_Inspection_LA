Dataset: The Health Department utilizes an inspection report and scoring system to evaluate food establishments in San Francisco. The scores, categorized as high, moderate, or low risk, reflect the severity of observed violations related to food safety. These scores are publicly accessible and follow the LIVES Flattened Schema, aligned with Yelp's health scores reference.

Problem Statements: Despite having a scoring system, it's challenging to clearly convey how serious violations are in San Francisco's food establishments. The current system may not be clear, making it difficult for people to make informed decisions about where to eat safely.

Objectives: Improve the clarity and accuracy of the inspection scoring system to provide clearer information about the safety of food establishments in San Francisco.
